This project is a very simple one for productivity and time management. Using the application is pretty easy, and getting started is way easier

> \***\*Author's note!!!\*\***: this documentation could be outdated! So, whenever you're stuck, just take a look at the code, I know it's ugly but that's the only way my friend

## Get started:

### - setup

#### installing the requirements

The only way right now to use the application is to clone the repo, then install the requirements with this command <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> in the command line.
<br>
then make sure that the application is working in your device by executing it <code>python main.py</code>.
<br>

#### Making an executable:

For making an executable file you can run the following command in the directory where main.py exists <code>pyinstaller -F -n focus {path_to_main.py}</code>
